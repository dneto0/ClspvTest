# Glossary of verbs for manifests
#
# module module-path
# Look for the files {module-path}.spv and {module-path}.spvmap in the assets directory, loading the
# module at runtime. Each entry point in the module will be compiled unless specified by a skip verb
# for that entry point. If entry points associated with a test2d verb will then also have the
# indicated test2d function executed on that entry point.
#
# skip entry-point
# Do not even compile entry-point (found in the most recently loaded module), just ignore it. This
# can be useful to work around driver bugs whereby compiling a given entry point has undesirable
# side effects (e.g. crashes the app).
#
# test2d entry-point test2d-entry workgroup-size-x workgroup-size-y (test2d-arg...)
# test3d entry-point test2d-entry workgroup-size-x workgroup-size-y workgroup-size-z (test2d-arg...)
# Run a test2d, specified by the test2d-entry name, against the entry-point (found in the most recently
# loaded module). test2d-entry is matched by a table internal to the application to look up the actual
# test2d function executed. The test2d is executed with the indicated workgroup size. Any additional
# test2d arguments are collected and passed (as a list of strings) to the test2d function itself. test2d
# arguments are, therefore, specific to each test2d function.
#
# verbosity [full|silent]
# Change the amount of output subsequent tests will emit.
# full - (default) instruct tests to emit as much detail about their results as they can
# silent - instruct tests to emit as little detail about their results as practical
#
# iterations num-iterations
# Change the number of times subsequent tests will run. The default number of iterations is 1.
# num-iterations must be positive. This could be useful for exploring timing of individual kernel
# execution (e.g. allowing one to run a test2d multiple times in rapid succession without having to
# launch ClspvTest multiple times.
#
# vkValidation [all|none]
# Instruct the test2d harness how to set up Vulkan validations layers for this test2d run. Note that
# the vkValidation verb affects all tests (different from verbosity and iterations, for example),
# with the last entry in the manifest affecting all tests in the test2d run.
# all - (default) install all validation layers before running tests
# none - install no validations layers before running tests
#
# end
# Stops processing the manifest. Everything after the end verb is ignored by the manifest parser
#
vkValidation all
